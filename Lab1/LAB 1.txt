HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) - is a standardized markup language
that is transferred via HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and displayed accordingly on the user side.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) — is a styling language that helps in formatting the HTML elements on the output.

JavaScript - is a scripting language that is capable of performing various client-side tasks (as well as server
side ones) affecting the HTML/CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers nowadays.

HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a protocol which in a sense works as a compiler of HTML text

HTML5 - latest HTML version which mainly intends on deprecating extra add-ins and plug-ins and gathering together
the three cornerstones of web — JS, CSS and HTML that are meant to be supported anywhere by anyone

Dynamic HTML (DHTML) - is a set of techniques that make web page vary over time. This has nothing to do with
the back end logic, but is achieved with help of Document Object Model technology, where JS can asynchronously
affect HTML and CSS.



Coding conventions is something a programmer must turn into personal routine.
Sure, I had my conventional habits, but what I would like to point out is:
1. I write new curly bracket on new line, not on the same e.g.
  for (var i=0; i<10; i++)
  {
    ...
  }
  Although, I felt used to it, I am working on giving a popular way its try. So from now on, I'll be trying
  to use the common indentation
  for (var i=0; i<10; i++) {
    ...
  }
2. I realized using TABs for indentation is not the best practice therefore double-space is to be used by me!
3. I am more comfortable with underscore separated variable names such as number_one instead of camel case numberOne.
  But that is still something I am trying to figure out for myself. I realized it depends also on the programming
  language itself. For example, In JavaScript people mostly use camelCase. So let's see which one will fit me better

  That's it. I think I am quite comfortable with how I create and tidy my script.


  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Sample page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Sample page</h1>
      <p>This is a <a href="demo.html">simple</a> sample.</p>
      <!-- this is a comment -->
    </body>
  </html>


  To attach an external CSS file we need to add <link> tag and provide path to its 'href' attribute.
  With JS we use the same script tag but leave its contents empty and just provide path to its 'src' attribute.

  To check if it works I simply called developer tools and checked if sources tab has my files listed in it.



  So Developer tools I use is from Google Chrome browser, they can be accessed by F12 button or by right clicking
  the needed element and pressing "Inspect". It has many useful functionalities for exploring certain pages or
  creating and testing your own. It has responsive features to test it on different mobile devices, list of DOM
  elements and a way to dynamically change them, JavaScript console, Server console with server request-responses
  and other security, performance etc. related tabs.
